Neural Network Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project implements a **neural network classifier** for recognizing handwritten digits (0-9) using **TensorFlow/Keras**. The model is trained on the **MNIST dataset**, a widely-used dataset consisting of 28x28 grayscale images.

Features
- Uses a fully connected neural network with ReLU activation.
- Trained on the MNIST dataset
- Achieves high accuracy on handwritten digit classification.
